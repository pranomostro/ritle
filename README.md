ritle-right to left (rtl) text for the cli
====================================

ritle is just a little program that lets you append
the characters you type at the left of the current
line instead of the right. This is useful when working
in environments with no native support for rtl text
or when working with array languages with rtl operator
precedence.

TODO: insert gif here showing it in action.

Building and installation
-------------------------

You're probably fine with

	make install

You need a C compiler and some standard unix
utilities.
