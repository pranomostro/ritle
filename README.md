ritle-right to left (rtl) text for the cli
==========================================

[![ritle demo](https://asciinema.org/a/8gzhlf1hf5jtobzixytsryqrq.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/8gzhlf1hf5jtobzixytsryqrq)

ritle is a little program that lets you append the characters you type
at the left of the current line instead of the right. This is useful
when working in environments with no native support for rtl text (e.g for
[hebrew, persian or arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left))
or when working with array languages with rtl operator precedence such as
[K](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona).
